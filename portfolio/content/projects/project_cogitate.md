## About the project

I participated in a software engineering project with the goal of creating a
tool that evaluates the level of contributions for each member within a GitHub
repository. I contributed to this project by implementing features that
displayed performance metrics of each member through visual representations
such as graphs with the use of Streamlit. This tool is able to generate an
overall score for each user based on various metrics such as:
teamwork performance, lines added/removed, and the amount of pull requests
which were created.

The current release of this project could be seen at the link below. [GatorCogitate](https://github.com/GatorCogitate/cogitate_tool)!
