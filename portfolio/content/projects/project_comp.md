## About the project

This project was completed as part of my Senior Project which is an independent
study in which I conducted research about a topic I found interest in. For my
senior project I decided to develop a tool that is able to predict the price of
Bitcoin based on the sentiments of Twitter tweets. I selected this project
because I have always found interest in cryptocurrencies and its future
implementation into financial systems. More specifically, a machine learning
algorithm was also used in conjunction with the VADER sentiment analysis
approach to give my model predictive power.

You can follow the link below to learn more about the datasets and methods of
approach used. [Bitcoin-Price-Prediction](https://github.com/TylerPham2000/Bitcoin-Price-Prediction)!
