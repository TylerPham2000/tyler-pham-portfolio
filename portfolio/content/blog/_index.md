My name is Tyler Pham. I am a currently a senior studying at Allegheny college
pursuing a double major in both computer science and economics.
My interests within the field of computer science is data analytics and
software-engineering. Aside from these interests, I am also interested in
economic fields that correlate with macroeconomics.

In addition to these interests I also have many hobbies that I partake in.
I have played golf at a competitive level over the course of my life ranging
from junior golf tournaments to the collegiate level. During my time at
Allegheny College I was a member of the mens golf team. In addition to golf, I
also have a passion for automobiles. Similar to golf, I have always been
interested in this hobby at a very young age.
